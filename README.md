## 🌟 Project Vision

> Most genetic prediction apps rely on expensive tests and lab work.  
> **Genome.Me** flips the script — using publicly available statistical insights, psychological frameworks, and behavioral predictors to give you a peek into your "digital genome".

🧪 Think of it as a futuristic personality DNA scanner — fun, educational, and thought-provoking.

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Fill out the basic form with your details and lifestyle info.  
2. The app runs a client-side analysis using pre-trained models & logic.  
3. See personalized insights, patterns, and possible tendencies.  
4. Use the insights for reflection, self-growth, or just fun.  

> No third-party servers, no API calls, no uploads — 100% local processing.

## 🔐 Privacy First
- No user data is stored, sent, or tracked
- All calculations are client-side only
- You own your insights

### 💬 This is not real genetic science — it’s pseudo-genetic profiling mixed with personality psychology, designed to be engaging, not diagnostic.

## 🧠 Inspiration
- Inspired by the idea that our behavior, environment, and habits often say more than our actual genes — this project brings the power of introspection and machine logic to your browser.
- No labs. No cost. Just pure predictive play.
